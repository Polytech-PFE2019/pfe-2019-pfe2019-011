# PFE 011: Computational Complexity of Puzzles and Games

This is a research-oriented project.
Part of it involves writing documentation about complexity proofs for existing games, to be added to the [Complexity of Games wiki](https://www.isnphard.com/).

This wiki's content is hosted [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/steven3k/complexity-of-games).
My working repository is [this fork](https://gitlab.com/a-gn/complexity-of-games), from which I will make pull requests to the upstream repository.
